No Room is a responsive web application built with Javascript technologies that shows available seats in Montreal caf√©s 
close to your location. 

## Features

- Cafe owners can log in and create their cafe with an interactive drag and drop seating layout created without libraries. 
- The user views a searchable map with location markers.
- On the cafe page, the seating layout will update live for the user as the owner indicates seats are taken.
